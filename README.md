If you don't have the node modules installed, run "npm install" first.

Once all modules are installed, "npm start" to start server, then navigate to localhost:3000.

To use with ngrok, first [download ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) and extract it to BoardViz-Prototype/ or the directory of your choice. Then run "./ngrok http 3000" from that directory.
